    <h2 class="lheader">About portability</h2>
    <p>Project was started as cross-platform with two main target platforms: few *nixes and Windows.
       But now I lost interest to Windows. Of cause, I don't remove code for Windows
       specially, but I don't check code on Windows platform and don't worry about Windows when writing new code
       during long time. But margine of code is enough, so this support may be added,
       if somebody would want use this project under Redmond's OS.
    </p>

    <h2 class="lheader">Platforms and Compilers, current state</h2>
    <p>My primary platform is Linux, but I made few efforts to suport FreeBSD.
    </p>

    <p>Well, in code I mentioned NetBSD and OpenBSD, but due to restrictions in
       threads implementation on this platforms, I'm expect problems here. 
    </p>

    <p>Really, I don't see blocking problems to use libraries from this project
       on any POSIX-compliant OS, that has good threads implementation.
    </p>

    <p>The same words applicable to compilers: now I use gcc 4.x, but 3.4 enough too
       or any other compiler, that implement modern C++ (near ISO/IEC 14882:2003
       standard).
    </p>

    <p>Other useful tools are not beyond the normal POSIX system tools, except Make:
       I'm expect GNU make 3.80 or better. Not too strong requirement for *nixes.
    </p>

    <p>In the past Complement work only with <a href="http://stlport.sourceforge.net">STLport</a> STL implementation. Now
       it may use any modern STL (libstdc++ in particular).
    </p>

    <p>Unit tests use <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/test/doc/components/utf/">Boost Unit Test Framework</a>.
    </p>

      Libraries worked with following platforms and C++ compilers:

          </tr>
      </table>
    </center>

    <h2 class="lheader">Other requirements, historical</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>GNU make v. 3.79.1 (for Unix-like platforms);</li>
      <li>Good C++ compiler; I hope now it is not problem:
        you can use GNU gcc 2.95.3, 3.1.1, or 3.2.x (other gcc versions may work too,
        but in particular I am not recommend to use gcc before 2.95.3,
        and early 3.x releases; 2.96, that shipout with RedHat,
        IMHO isn't good choice too);
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://stlport.sourceforge.net">STLport</a>---STL implementation.
        Very efficient, very portable STL implementation. Instead of
        have troubles with different (and sometimes ugly) STL implementations
        that come with C++ compilers, I use STLport.
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> interpreter
        to make more-or-less automatic tests.
      </li>
    </ul>
