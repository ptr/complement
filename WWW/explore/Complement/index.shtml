    <h1>Complement C++ libraries</h1>
    <h2>What is this</h2>
    <p>
      Complement is a set of C++ libraries.
      This libraries provide multiplatform C++ framework
      for multithreaded programming and communication.
    </p>

<!--
<h2>Key features</h2>
C++ is a very power language. Many programming problems may be solved with
only C++ usage, without special preprocessing. You see, C preprocessor
is very power, and it is a part of every C++ compiler, so why we need
to use another?
-->

    <h2>Brief Description</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>xmt</dt>
      <dd>
        Portable programming interface to build MultiThreaded (MT)
        applications or libraries. Hide platform-specific 
        system calls that used for MT-programming.
      </dd>
      <dt>sockios</dt>
      <dd>
        Generic interface for interprocess communication via sockets.
        Sockios programming interface unified with C++ standard (ISO/IEC 14882)
        IO streams interface. 
      </dd>
      <dt>EDS</dt>
      <dd>
        EDS is Event Driven System. Framework for
        asynchronous events delivery and processing.
        Here a bit more than only callback interface.
        Object that process some event has a so-called 'state' (really stack
        of states), so event
        processors may vary while object change state (as specified
        in compile time).
        Communication
        with events in EDS framework possible as within single process,
        as between different processes (wold-wide too), over TCP or UDP
        (framework provided by libsockios). In contrast to similar frameworks,
        to process EDS-designed code you need only C++ compiler.

    <h2>Present State of Complement Project</h2>

    <p>
      Active development for Unix-like systems
      (Solaris and Linux, I have no access to HP-UX now) with
      gcc 3.1.1/STLport 5.x. Some time ago this libraries was working on Windows
      (95, 98, NT) with VC++ 5 SP3 (client part, connections processing server never
      work on MS Windows), HP-UX 11.00 (HP aCC A.03.13) and Solaris (SunSoft CC 5.2).
