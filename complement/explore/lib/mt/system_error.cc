     was indicated by EWOULDBLOCK, which was a distinct error code
     different from EAGAIN. To make your program portable, you should
     check for both codes and treat them the same.
 
   * A temporary resource shortage made an operation impossible. fork
     can return this error.  It indicates that the shortage is expected to
     pass, so your program can try the call again later and it may succeed.
     It is probably a good idea to delay for a few seconds before trying it
     again, to allow time for other processes to release scarce resources.
     Such shortages are usually fairly serious and affect the whole system,
