This is intercessor, request proxy from php to reportware.

Options:
  -h [ --help ]             print help message
  -p [ --port=] arg (=8080) listen port (default 8080)
  -s [ --save ] arg         store uploaded stream to files in this catalog (default none)
  -t [ --timeout=] arg (=3) timeout for response from ReportWare Server, seconds (default 3)
  -d [ --daemon ]           become daemon

Compilation (on fresh commit):

./configure
make

The results will be in build/bin and build/lib
For installation you will need following files:

build/bin:
intercessor*

build/lib: following command give you names of required files

ldd build/bin/intercessor | grep /build/lib/ | awk '{ v = system( "readlink " $3); b = system( "basename " $3 ); }'

If you developer, and and use 'svn update', following make tags may be useful for you:
make check --- Build and run all possible unit tests for libraries and applications
               related to 'intercessor' application.

make depend  --- calculate build dependencies

make clean --- Delete object files, intermediate depenedency files
               that are created by building the program. However,
	       don't delete the files that record the configuration.
	       Also preserve dependencies file, tags files and resulting
	       program or library.

make distclean --- Same as 'clean' plus delete resulting program(s) or
               libraie(s) files, dependencies file and directories that
	       used for compilation and linking (directories should be
	       empty at this stage). `make distclean' should leave only
	       the files that were in the distribution.
