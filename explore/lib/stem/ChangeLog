	* libEDS: library renamed to 'stem' == lower of 'StEM'

	* libstem: compilation with present libxmt and libsockios

2001-07-27  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* libEDS: Version 3.5.2
	
	* Makefile.gcc (Repository): provide workaround for
	bug in GNU make 3.79*---it foget old value of variable when
	tag-dependent variable use += operator, if includes of makefiles
	is too deep---near deepth of 3. This influence to libraries building.
	Add explicit link with other C++ shared libraries---this significantly
	reduce library size.

2001-06-13  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* NetTransport.cc (Repository): The limit of EDS message is increased
	from 1M to 4M;

2001-06-05  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* Makefile.inc (Message): library version 3.5.0
	This reflect real major libEDS release.

2001-06-04  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* libEDS: Work with STLport 4.5 beta 8 (from stlport cvs);
	remove obsolete in any case dependence from non-STLport iostreams
	realization (it should not work).

2001-06-01  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* The fork and become_daemon now in xmt library.

	* New exception class fork_in_parent added in xmt.

	* libEDS: version 0.5.0
	
2001-03-20  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* Modified namespace to satisfy STLport 4.1 beta 5

	* EvSession.h:
	problems with non-inline copy constructor and operator (VC5 sp3)

	* Satisfy for STLport 4.1 beta 5.

	* Increment patch number.

2001-03-01  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* sockios:
	setoptions for socket moved from basic_sockbuf to sockstream.

	* Incremented patch number (in version presentation) after sockstream
	modifications.

2001-02-15  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* Change version

2001-02-06  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* Under hard load I see the same behavior as under HP-UX and Linux.
	Fix code: remove difference in code between Solaris and non-Solaris
	for MCSF polisy of socket manager.

	* EvSession.h, _EvSession.cc:
	Added copy constructor and assignment operator. All MT-unsafe
	operations are protected now. Public accesable operations return
	copy of object, not reference.

	* EventHandler.h:
	Destructor marked as virtual.

	* NetTransport.h, NetTransport.cc:
	Unsafe operations with sessions are protected now. Public accessable
	operations return copy of SessionInfo instead of reference.

2001-01-30  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* Cron:
	Remove event from Cron service with consideration of arg number.

	* NetTransport:
	We should not erase session when control object exist, but should
	do this when no such object.

2001-01-22  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* Approach for fix problem with lost info about closed connections
	on non-Solaris OSes. Should be checked on other OS, including Solaris
	and non-MP variant.

	* Cron: I should use RemoveState(), not PopState()

2001-01-16  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* Cron (Cron.h, Cron.cc, NetTransport.cc):
	only one Cron loop thread per instance start now, it go	to suspended
	state if no messages in queue instead of exit.

	* NetTransportMgs (NetTransport.h):
	before open we sure that _loop terminated.

	* Increment libEDS version.

2000-12-29  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* Cron (Cron.h, EvPack.h, Cron.cc):
	Start of cron events: added nanoseconds;
	Cron entry has now unsigned argument, and notification send
	this argument.

	* NetTransport (NetTransport.h, NetTransport.cc):
	Fix problem for NetTransportMgr: when close communication socket I
	join thread with read (pop) loop.

2000-12-08  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* Change STLport version
	
2000-12-06  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

2000-12-05  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* Cron: Add wait to Cron---no join_all for POSIX threads.

2001-11-21  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* Cron.cc: Accept zero period if event planning to send only once.

2000-11-04  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParallelGraphics.COM>

	* sockios:
	Multiplexsor variant of Sock manager---data from net, that was
	readed from net and buffered in sockbuf, not extracted befor next
	data recieved (I wait on poll). Now I check is available data
	in buffer and return this sockstream if yes before calling poll.
	
2000-09-12  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParaGraph.Ru>

	* libEDS:
	ifdef #ident directive (for vary compilers)
	Removed wrong 'explicit' declaration:
  	'explicit' may be used only for converting constructors.
	this-> for inherited functions (HP's aCC A.03.13 don't understand
	inheritance and 'using' clause). Created Makefiles for HP's aCC
	compiler. Workarounds for HP's aCC names resolution.
	This is release that start working on HP-UX 11.00 (with aCC A.03.13).

2000-08-10  Petr Ovchenkov  <ptr@ParaGraph.Ru>

	EDSEventsCore, etc.) in spirit of separate libraries.

1996-11-03  Petr Ovchenkov  

	* libOXW:
	The events transfer has made as const event transfer. This has done
