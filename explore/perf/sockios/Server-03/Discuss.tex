\section{Computers and Networks}

Computers and operational environments that used in tests:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item AMD Athlon XP 1500+ (two-way) under Linux (kernel 2.4.17),
        Ethernet card: Intel Corp. 82557 [Ethernet Pro 100].\label{fort}
  \item Intel Pentium 133MHz under Linux (kernel 2.4.17),
        Ethernet card: RealTek RTL8139 Fast Ethernet.\label{oldnavy}
  \item Intel Pentium III 803MHz under Solaris 8,
        Ethernet card: Intel 82558/82559 [EEPRO 100+].\label{ermine}
\end{enumerate}

Network between systems \ref{fort} and \ref{oldnavy}: 100Mb Ethernet,
UTP level 5, point-to-point connection (no hubs, routers,
switches or other devices between computers).

\section{Compilers}

On all systems was used GNU gcc 3{.}1{.}1 ($C{+}{+}$ or $C$, depends
upon programs).

\section{Tests Goals}

I want to compare performance of sockios library with ``pure C code''
(near the fastest code based on the same system calls, even with
reduced functionality for simplification).
I expect that this results will help to detect problems and 
to find a ways for improvements.

\section{Tests description}

\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Start server.
  \item Start client.
  \item Client connect to the server and send $n$ blocks of size $b$;
        server read all sended by client data and write ones into one
        buffer of size $b$, data overwritten.
\end{enumerate}

This procedure repeat $10$ times. During tests we collect some statistic
data: client and server user CPU time, system CPU timThen we find mean values and dispersion. So we can estimate the real
o we can estimate the real
load from client and server programs in the real environments.

In case of client and server run on different computers, we start server on
the local system, login via \texttt{ssh} on remote hoste and start here client.
Login via ssh is done under \texttt{ssh-agent}, to avoid manual password typing.

We compare results of sockios library with ``ideal'' times from
C-written programs with restricted functionality (no buffering, no multiple
clients processing on server side, no multithreading).

Due to ``time'' function has different options and output format on Linux
and Solaris, we use program \texttt{time} from this
bundle\footnote{Portabilty note: system should has \texttt{wait3} function.}.
By the way this function use high-precision time measure.

Client connect to the server and send $n$ blocks of size $b$ via TCP/IP protocol.
The numbers $n$ and $b$ choose so that $n b = 52428800$ (i.e. client send
to the server $50$M). We make estimations for $5$ cases:
\begin{itemize}
  \item many small messages ($b = 32$);
  \item basic message size ($b = 1024$, i.e. $1$K);
  \item messages of page size ($b = 4096$, i.e. $4$K);
  \item large messages ($b = 1048576$, i.e. $1$M);
  \item huge messages ($b = 52428800$, i.e. $50$M).
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \input p1.tex
    % \epsfig{file=p1.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Local Loopback, sockios: system \ref{fort}.}
\end{figure}

You see, that extremely large number of short packages lead to
performance degeneration. For unbuffered write/read this degenration
is so much, I skip this results on plot (figure~\ref{C-local-3})

For loopback communtication we see evident minima. I think, that
exact minima point should be for block size $65\,565$---the maxima size
that \texttt{write} system call can put into socket without blocking
(with default settings of OS'es I used).

From figures \ref{local-1} and \ref{C-local-1} we see that user's times
are near the same as for sockios-based client, as for ``pure $C$ code''.
But server kernel time for sockios-based program is
doubled against ``pure $C$ code'' (that increase elapsed time).
User's time for sockios-based server is exceed one for ``pure $C$ code''
server too.

This may be due to sockios-based server start new thread for connection,
but separate test (establish connection without sending data) not confirm
this assumption.

           systems \ref{fort} (server) and \ref{oldnavy} (client).\label{local-1}}

  \caption{Local Loopback, restricted code on $C$: system \ref{fort}.\label{C-local-1}}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \input p5.tex
  \end{center}
  \caption{Local Loopback, restricted code on $C$: system \ref{ermine}.
           Test results for block size $32$ skiped here; one has 
           mean elapsed time $128.637$s, client system mean 
           time $6.088$s, client user mean time $1.133$s, server system
           mean time $114.252$s, server user mean time $1.951$s.\label{local-C-ermine}}
\end{figure}

Really, systems can send/receive only $64$K at once
(default settings, local loopback, \texttt{read}/\texttt{write} system calls
without return). This fact we see on the figure~\ref{local-C-ermine}:
with tiny packets and unbuffered data system has so bad performance,
I removed this point from picture, to avoid too small scale of other results.
